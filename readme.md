# üïµÔ∏è hugo-watcher

This container watches Hugo theme or layout folders and triggers a safe reload of the site by briefly rewriting a content file.

## ‚úÖ Why Use This

Hugo's livereload often misses layout or Tailwind CSS changes ‚Äî especially inside Docker. This watcher safely triggers a Hugo rebuild by rewriting an existing content file, without altering its content.

## üê≥ Usage

Include it in your `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
watcher:
  image: inigoetxaniz/hugo-watcher
  volumes:
    - ./web:/site
  user: "${UID}:${GID}"
  environment:
    - RELOAD_DELAY_MS=200
```

Make sure Hugo and this watcher use the same UID/GID to avoid permission issues.
